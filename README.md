The above is the source code for the paper “GTRSS: Graph-based Top-k Representative Similar
Subtrajectory Query”. Some of the related datasets are under Build, but due to the file size being too large, they have been released. 
You can download the. tar file. The above code can be used to test the performance of querying on the Chengdu dataset. Currently, 
the paper is under submission. If the paper is accepted, I will once again make the entire source code and dataset public.
Please feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
