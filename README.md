The above is the source code for the paper “GTRSS: Graph-based Top-k Representative Similar
Subtrajectory Query”. Some of the related datasets are under Build, but due to the file size being too large, they have been uploaded to Released. 
The dataset and build files have also been uploaded, and can be downloaded from Tag. 
The above code can be used to test the performance of querying on the Chengdu dataset. Currently, 
the paper is under submission. Please feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
